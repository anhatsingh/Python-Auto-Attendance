## About

This package uses the **OCR engine** - `libtesseract` and a **command line program** - `tesseract`
with **UB-Manheim** English train-data to mark attendance of Google Meet participants in Google Sheets

The lead developer is Anhat Singh

This package uses various python libraries to take attendance effeciently and make google sheets using **Google Sheets API v4**

## Brief history

Tesseract was originally developed at Hewlett-Packard Laboratories Bristol and
at Hewlett-Packard Co, Greeley Colorado between 1985 and 1994, with some
more changes made in 1996 to port to Windows, and some C++izing in 1998.
In 2005 Tesseract was open sourced by HP. Since 2006 it is developed by Google.

The latest (LSTM based) stable version is **[4.1.1](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/releases/tag/4.1.1)**, released on December 26, 2019.
Latest source code is available from [master branch on GitHub](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/tree/master).
Open issues can be found in [issue tracker](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/issues),
and [planning documentation](https://tesseract-ocr.github.io/tessdoc/Planning.html).

The latest 3.0x version is **[3.05.02](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/releases/tag/3.05.02)**, released on June 19, 2018. Latest source code for 3.05 is available from [3.05 branch on GitHub](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/tree/3.05).
There is no development for this version, but it can be used for special cases (e.g. see [Regression of features from 3.0x](https://tesseract-ocr.github.io/tessdoc/Planning.html#regression-of-features-from-30x)).

See **[Release Notes](https://tesseract-ocr.github.io/tessdoc/ReleaseNotes.html)**
and **[Change Log](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/blob/master/ChangeLog)** for more details of the releases.

## Installing Tesseract

You can either [Install Python-Auto-Attendance via pre-built binary package](https://tesseract-ocr.github.io/tessdoc/Home.html)
or **build it from source**

## Dependencies

### Building the Package
If you are building the package yourself, follow the steps to build properly:
1. Install the Python dependencies by running the following pip commands
    ```
    pip install pysimplegui
    pip install selenium
    pip install pyautogui
    pip install pygetwindow
    pip install --upgrade google-api-python-client google-auth-httplib2 google-auth-oauthlib
    pip install pyscreenshot
    pip install pytesseract
    pip install opencv-python
    ```
2. Install `UB-Mannheim Windows pre-built binary` of [Tesseract-OCR](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract) from [here](https://tesseract-ocr.github.io/tessdoc/Home.html#binaries)

(Note: Make sure you are installing at default directory only, and not changing it)
3. Use the included `chromedriver.exe` or download the latest one from [ChromeDriver - WebDriver for Chrome](https://chromedriver.chromium.org/) and keep it in the root directory
4. Follow bullet 3 and 4 of Prerequisites at [Google Sheets API v4 Guide](https://developers.google.com/sheets/api/quickstart/python) to create a Google Cloud Platform Project, enable Sheets API and get the Google `credentials.json` file to be put into the root directory.

## Running Tesseract

Basic **[command line usage](https://tesseract-ocr.github.io/tessdoc/Command-Line-Usage.html)**:

    tesseract imagename outputbase [-l lang] [--oem ocrenginemode] [--psm pagesegmode] [configfiles...]

For more information about the various command line options use `tesseract --help` or `man tesseract`.

Examples can be found in the [documentation](https://tesseract-ocr.github.io/tessdoc/Command-Line-Usage.html#simplest-invocation-to-ocr-an-image).

## For developers

Developers can use `libtesseract` [C](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/blob/master/include/tesseract/capi.h) or
[C++](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/blob/master/include/tesseract/baseapi.h) API to build their own application.
If you need bindings to `libtesseract` for other programming languages, please see the
[wrapper](https://tesseract-ocr.github.io/tessdoc/AddOns.html#tesseract-wrappers) section in the AddOns documentation.

Documentation of Tesseract generated from source code by doxygen can be found on [tesseract-ocr.github.io](https://tesseract-ocr.github.io/).

## Dependencies

Tesseract uses [Leptonica library](https://github.com/DanBloomberg/leptonica)
for opening input images (e.g. not documents like pdf).
It is suggested to use leptonica with built-in support for [zlib](https://zlib.net),
[png](https://sourceforge.net/projects/libpng) and
[tiff](http://www.simplesystems.org/libtiff) (for multipage tiff).
