# Python-Auto-Attendance
Download PyTesseract from https://github.com/UB-Mannheim/tesseract/wiki

## How to Run
In Windows PowerShell, or CMD type:
<br />
<code> py main.py </code>

Arguments: <br />
<code> [optional] -d <Date in dd-mm-yyyy format></code>
  
## Todo
1. The tesseract method alone is not reliable enough to get the list of presentees, so still have to devise another method that will go in-hand with tesseract one.
2. The Google Sheet ID is hard-coded into the code, still have to devise a method to get the sheet id based on its name, if at all possible.
3. Screenshots still have to be provided to the python. Will add functionality to automatically take screenshots too.
